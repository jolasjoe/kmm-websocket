# Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile websocket example

This project was created using the [Networking and data storage with Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile](https://github.com/kotlin-hands-on/kmm-networking-and-data-storage) example as a starting point. Then the code [here](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/mobile/connect-to-platform-specific-apis.html#example-send-and-receive-messages-from-a-websocket) was copied into the project to have a ready to go KMM websocket example.
